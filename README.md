# Masters-Research
Here is my final research for my Master of IT degree. This was a semester-long project (not a full-length Master's thesis) completed June 2024 at The University of Melbourne. It was completed under the supervision of Dr. Christine Rizkallah. I am very grateful for Christine's work in guiding me through the research process and her patience in understanding my all-over-the-place ideas. In the end I decided that a career in research was not for me, but I'm very grateful for the insightful introduction to the world of academia nonetheless.

The project was focused on demonstrating how the differential privacy guarantees of programs can be validated using Kuifje, a programming language for Quantitative Information Flow (QIF). That sentence might not have made much sense to almost anyone unless you're one of the experts in the area of QIF, and one of the main challenges of this project was learning how to communicate highly technical, original research in a way that a non-expert could understand.

Some relatively (and I mean, relatively) gentle introductions to a couple of the topics in the paper:
[Differential Privacy](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/the_algorithmic_foundations_of_differential_privacy_0.pdf)
[Quantitative Information Flow](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-96131-6)

My Kuifje programs can be found [here](https://github.com/AH-Miller/kuifje-compiler/tree/master/PlausibleDeniability). Kuifje is a prototype programming language deeply embedded in Haskell. None of the work on the language itself is my own. I thank Vincent Jackson, who is part of the development team, for helping to clear up misunderstandings I had with the language, and for promptly responding to bugs my work uncovered in the language.
